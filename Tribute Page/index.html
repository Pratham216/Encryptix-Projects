			<h2 class="hdr-txt">Biography</h2>
			<p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc., chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. He continued pushing the company’s vision forward with his ideas for sleek design, branding, and intuitive technology.  The release of the Macbook Air, iPod, iPhone, iPad left other companies scrambling to replicate Apple’s formula for success.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>February 24, 1955:</strong><br>Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological parents.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1961:</strong><br>The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon Valley.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1968:</strong><br>Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1970:</strong><br>Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1972:</strong><br>Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1974:</strong><br>Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1976:</strong><br>Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.</li><br>

Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock.
